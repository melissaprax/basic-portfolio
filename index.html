                            <p>What I am not: I shy away from a “hit-it-and-quit-it” mentality. 
                                I am not hasty. I can’t remember the last time I was “bored.” I am not complacent.</p>
        
                                    <p>What I am: I am unapologetically unafraid. I radiate with curiosity and a desire to create beautiful, 
                                            thought-provoking and meticulously-checked work. I am open to always learning new things, talking to 
                                            new people and exploring new places.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I’m a digital journalist, who currently creates social-friendly and short documentary style news videos for Newsy. 
                                    I have been featured in online outlets, including, Elephant Journal and Women Under Siege. I feel the most 
                                    passionate about covering topics like: women’s empowerment, humanitarian efforts and human rights, 
                                    social issues and slashing misconceptions with well-researched facts and studies. I think I always 
                                    knew I had a calling to communicate, but found my niche in journalism transpire out of a multimedia high 
                                    school program and later a B.A. in Public Affairs Journalism from the Ohio State University. While at OSU, 
                                    I also dived into learning Arabic, a language I adore, and am still mastering. I am based in Chicago, Illinois, 
                                    and am currently pursuing a coding bootcamp through Northwestern. In my free time, I volunteer as an 
                                    ESL tutor for resettled refugees.</p>
