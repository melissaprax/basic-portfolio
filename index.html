                         I am not hasty. I can’t remember the last time I was “bored.” I am not complacent.

                          new people and exploring new places.

                      <p class="t-a-c fPO fs20px mt-20px">I’m a digital journalist, who currently creates social-friendly and short documentary style news videos for Newsy. 
                         I have been featured in online outlets, including, Elephant Journal and Women Under Siege. I feel the most 
                         passionate about covering topics like: women’s empowerment, humanitarian efforts and human rights, 
                         social issues and slashing misconceptions with well-researched facts and studies. I think I always 
                         knew I had a calling to communicate, but found my niche in journalism transpire out of a multimedia high 
                         school program and later a B.A. in Public Affairs Journalism from the Ohio State University. While at OSU, 
                         I also dived into learning Arabic, a language I adore, and am still mastering. I am based in Chicago, Illinois, 
                         and am currently pursuing a coding bootcamp through Northwestern. In my free time, I volunteer as an 
                         ESL tutor for resettled refugees.
